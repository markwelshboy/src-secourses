i need you to write me 100 different unique prompts

here the requirements

these prompts will be used to generate images

each prompt has to be single line

do not give me output as titled or sectioned or grouped etc just raw prompt

now each prompt must be at least 225 words

make them extremely detailed

the prompts has to be constructed for digital artworks

so do not have any any words that would be used to describe real photography  

use words that would be used in digital artworks paintings pixel art and such non real photography images

make different ages, different clothings etc in prompts i want to be very imaginative 

like an armored warrior, or suit wearing person, or studio headshot photo or a blacksmith in middle age or a warrior battling against a dragon etc 

the name of the man in every prompt is ohwx so make prompts as ohwx man

when constructing prompts do not write as ohwx man as a warrior make it as warrior ohwx man 

so construct sentences with image generation models understanding way basically how you would describe an image 

construct prompts in a way that background wont be blurry or fuzzy 

also make the person wearing eyeglasses because he wears always

also when constructing the prompt avoid description that would describe his facial features or age or racial characteristics

because all such things makes generated image not loyal to the person

so define the prompts in details without such description that would change the facial racial skin and such features and attributes of the person

important in the images the man should look at the camera so construct the prompt in a way that the ohwx man looks at the camera face front

when writing the prompt add lots of keywords that would describe the style of the image, if painting related to painting style, if render, related to render style, if cell shaded, related to it, if anime related to it

so with style related keywords that wouldnt overwrite the character facial attributes, we can get more stylized better quality images

when writing the prompt also add most important style part to beginning

like digital drawing of ...
oil painting of ...
pixel art of...
3d render of...
anime drawing of...
cel shaded art of...
game artwork of...
pencil art of...
pastel art of...
or such i am not sure you are the expert
think a lot before writing prompts because the beginning of the prompt also matters hugely

make extremely different variety of art styles prompts
