We have a special coupon for L40, A6000 and A6000 ALT config : SECourses

A6000 and A6000 ALT config will be 31 cents per hour with our coupon
L40 will be 49 cents per hour with our coupon - recommended since it has over 2x disk compared to A6000 and faster

Select an L40 and use our code SECourses for huge discount.

If L40 not available or you need cheaper select A6000 GPU or A6000 GPU ALT (if A6000 is not available)
